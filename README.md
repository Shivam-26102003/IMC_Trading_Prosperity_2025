## ðŸ“ˆ Project Overview

The goal of this competition was to create an automated trading strategy capable of competing in a real-time, high-speed, and highly dynamic trading environment. We leveraged both quantitative analysis and strategic decision-making under pressure to build robust, fast, and adaptive trading bots.

## ðŸ§  Strategy Highlights

Our strategy focused on:

- **Market Making:** Providing liquidity on both sides of the order book.
- **Arbitrage:** Detecting and exploiting price discrepancies between related instruments.
- **Signal Processing:** Using statistical methods to predict short-term market moves.
- **Risk Management:** Implementing strict limits on exposure and volatility.

We iteratively refined our strategies based on performance logs, market metrics, and order book behavior during the simulation rounds.
